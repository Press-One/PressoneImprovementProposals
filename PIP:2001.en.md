## 1. Introduction

The PIP:2001 protocol uses the PRS chain to deliver Topic related messages. This is useful for content publishing or content aggregating under Topics.

By using this protocol, publishers could control their data instead of service providers, and be able to publish content URL and file hash as a global index. Subscribers will receive the Topics updates from the blockchain and can fetch the content to build aggregate feeds.

PIP:2001 makes it possible to build a distributed digital content publish network.

## 2. Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

**Owner** : The administrator of one Topic, who has permissions to allow/deny users to publish content under the Topic.
**Publisher**: The content publisher
**Subscriber**: The topic subscriber
**API Service**:  The service of content aggregation


## 3. Architecture
### 3.1 Owner

Usage: For managing the permissions list. The owner's pubAddress is his default Topic. 

MUST: Publish one or more permission rules.
RECOMMENDED: Generating sub keypairs and the owner would have many different Topics.

Data format：
allow/deny | pubAddress

id:"",
data:{
    "[allow|deny]":"pubAddress",
    "topic":"6d318BE3657FBc0515a0ab4945c21Be0f17D935f"
}

Example:

Allow three users to publish content under owner's Topic.

ALLOW:1800246B58dC9EdF07013b66A5A6800a9596F419,3dDDE8416F24BcCAc86505Eb598fd455C7C2bf74,697667E0c877c6F9927Ebb171058ADdA76A82424

id:"",
data:{
    "allow": "1800246B58dC9EdF07013b66A5A6800a9596F419,3dDDE8416F24BcCAc86505Eb598fd455C7C2bf74,697667E0c877c6F9927Ebb171058ADdA76A82424",
    "topic":"6d318BE3657FBc0515a0ab4945c21Be0f17D935f"
}

Deny one user to publish content under owner's Topic.

DENY:3dDDE8416F24BcCAc86505Eb598fd455C7C2bf74

id:"",
data:{
    "deny": "3dDDE8416F24BcCAc86505Eb598fd455C7C2bf74",
    "topic":"6d318BE3657FBc0515a0ab4945c21Be0f17D935f"
}


### 3.2 Publisher

Usage: Publish content to a Topic
MUST: Can hashing the content
MUST: Generate the data and meta for the blockchain.
MUST: Private key to make a secp256k1 signature.
MUST: Publish to the blockchain
OPTIONAL: Update:id, Update content with specific id. (for the same publisher with the same pubAddress)
RECOMMENDED: encryption, Declaration of the content encryption and algorithms.
RECOMMENDED: Generating sub keypairs for different Topics.
RECOMMENDED: Use IPFS/BT to storage content files, and use "ipfs://" as the url.

Example : "hello world"
data.file_hash: b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
Topic: 6d318BE3657FBc0515a0ab4945c21Be0f17D935f
Meta: https://mydomain/content/$1
(optional) Update:id
(recommended) encryption : "PGP"

Recommended: Declare the the content encryption and algorithms with the sender id in the Meta object. Publishers and Subscribers should negotiate the algorithm and exchange their shared secret.

Notice: You can save only a unique ID in the meta data object, and share the method of the ID decode algorithm with the Publisher and Subscriber.

id:"",
"data": {
    "file_hash": "5cd084646ebdc025f532ad0d0df773eaf2860464fedba029a133c719307ec220"
    "topic":"6d318BE3657FBc0515a0ab4945c21Be0f17D935f"
},
"meta": {
    "mime": "text/markdown;charset=UTF-8",
    "encryption" : "PGP"
    "uris": [
        "https://mydomain.com/myid.md"
    ]
}


### 3.3 Subscriber

Usage: Sort date on Topic
MUST: Check the latest block/Tx, and save all the block transactions match the definition of PIP:2001. Included: Publisher Management and content Published
MUST: Maintain a local list of Publisher Manager data status.
MUST: Verify Publisher Management list match the signature, then build the published data list.
MUST: Response the Update data, then update the content.
SHOULD: Implement the URL parser. recommended implement included: http/https/ipfs/magnet
MUST NOT: Any data can't match their signature should be drop.
MUST NOT: Any Update data can't match their signature should be drop.
OPTIONAL: Keep historical versions of content before Update.
OPTIONAL: Keep logs of Publisher Managerment permissions status change.

Example：

allow:1800246B58dC9EdF07013b66A5A6800a9596F419,3dDDE8416F24BcCAc86505Eb598fd455C7C2bf74,697667E0c877c6F9927Ebb171058ADdA76A82424
deny:3dDDE8416F24BcCAc86505Eb598fd455C7C2bf74

Result list:
1800246B58dC9EdF07013b66A5A6800a9596F419,697667E0c877c6F9927Ebb171058ADdA76A82424

Any publish under the Topic must match their signature, otherwise should be drop.


### 3.4 API Service

Usage：Restful API
MUST: Compliance with the list of Users status.
MAY: Using CDN to cache pages.
SHOULD NOT: Don't keep the old data. The service should keep tracing the latest data.


## 4 REST API

### 4.1 Publisher Management

Maintain the Publisher list. Call this API will add new data to the blockchain. Sort all of the Publisher Management data (old to new), and update the status with ALLOW/DENY data, the result is the publisher status list. 

Owner is the signer of those message. The pubAddress of the signer is the Topic.

POST /publisher/{topic}
Content-Format:  application/json
Payload: 

data:{
    "[allow|deny]":"topic"
}

Success: 200 Successful
Failure: 401 Unauthorized, signature not match.

### 4.2 Publish

For publishing content. Use this API to create or update the content. Call this API will add new payload to the blockchain, included topic,file_hash and meta. 

POST /publish
Content-Format:  application/json
Payload: 

"data": {
    "file_hash": "5cd084646ebdc025f532ad0d0df773eaf2860464fedba029a133c719307ec220"
    "topic":"6D318be3657fbC0515A0AB4945C21bE0F17d935F"
},
"meta": {

### 4.4 Feed

Output the feeds of specific  Topic, in ATOM format.

GET /feeds/[topic]
Content-Format:  application/json

ATOM described in [RFC4287]

-----------------

## TODO:

DNS TOPIC，在DNS记录中增加TXT记录PIP2001:[topic pubAddress] 

1. 所有写入内容，比如url，要确定最大长度
2. publish 之后可以通过状态同步去修改和标记删除
